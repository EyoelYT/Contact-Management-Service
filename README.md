How would I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Use automated testing techniques such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure correct functionality of the software. An ideal scenario would be a system that runs tests automatically every time code is committed to the codebase.
- Use secure coding practices (validating user inputs, use parameterized queries, encrypt sensitive data, and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date.
- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews
